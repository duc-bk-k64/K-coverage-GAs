# K-coverage-GAs
I use evolutionary algorithms to solve np-hard and np-complete problems.
Project has 3 package:
  1-K-coverage to solve k-coverage and m-connected problem in wireless sensor network.
  2-MFEA-TSP use MFEA to solve TSP and TRP problems.
  3-MEFA_TSP_KP use MFEA to solve TSP  and KP problems.
  4-TSP use GAs solve TSP problems.
